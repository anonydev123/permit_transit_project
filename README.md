# permit_transit_project

This is a project i did for a bussiness of my client. 
In this project there is a simple interface of entering a users information and storing the information in a database in my case i have used mongodb and after the user hits submit button a new is directed(details.ejs) in which there is a specific format which displays the information entered by the user and provides a pdf and enters the deatils in the pdf using the entered information and displays it below the information. 
The main problem i faced in this project was to used the stored data to fill a pdf template. I used pdf-lib api to fill the pdf.
